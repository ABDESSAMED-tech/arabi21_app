# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to

publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.

# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
        - assets/headerlogo.ico
        - assets/logoblack.png
        - assets/fb.png
        - assets/insta.png
        - assets/profileimg.png
        - assets/travelone.png
        - assets/traveltwo.png
        - assets/travelthree.png
        - assets/travelfour.png
        - assets/travelfive.png
        - assets/travelsix.png
        - assets/online_support_100px.png
        - assets/favorites.ico
        - assets/nofavorites.ico
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: abdoullah
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/abdoullah_ashgar_el_kharef.ttf
           
         
    - family: jalah
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/jalah.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
    - family: advertisingbold
      fonts:
         - asset: assets/fonts/advertisingbold.ttf
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
